/**
 * This class is intended for some heavy concurrent event operations
 * (like writing to database or file).
 *
 * On registration of new {@link IEvent} the instance of {@link EventData} is created with
 * the {@link IEventDataFactory} that can add some additional information like system info
 * or version.
 * This data instance is immediately cached with {@link IEventDataCache} that can for example
 * merge data with the same signature by summing there count.
 * If the previous processing operation is finished and the wait time is passed then the next event is retrieved from cache
 * (it may be for example based on some comparator like the biggest count, if {@link EventDataCacheComparatorBased}
 * is used, or just queue based if the {@link EventDataCacheQueueBased} is used or any other order determined by
 * custom cache) and the processing is started asynchronously
 *
 * This class can be considered thread-safe if the cache and factory instances aren't used anywhere else in the code.
