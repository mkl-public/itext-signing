# The PKCS#11 device used

For the tests [SoftHSM2](https://www.opendnssec.org/softhsm/), the [Utimaco Simulator](https://hsm.utimaco.com/products-hardware-security-modules/hsm-simulators/securityserver-simulator/), and Belgian ID cards in ACS zetes card readers are used as devices addressed via PKCS#11.

Installation and configuration details are explained in the `README.md` of the parallel project `mkl.itext.signing:itext-signing-pkcs11` which also focuses on signing with iText 7 via PKCS#11 but runs in a newer JRE.
